📖 Signly Database
🚀 Overview

Signly Database is a Django-based application for managing and organizing datasets related to sign language recognition.
It stores structured information such as CSV files (with hand/face landmarks) and video recordings (.mp4), making it easier to prepare data for AI models.
(This project represents my second experience designing and deploying a Django-based database, building upon my earlier work with relational data management)
